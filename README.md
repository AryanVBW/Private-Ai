# üöÄ Welcome to Private-AI!

Private-AI is an innovative AI project designed for asking questions about your documents using powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). The unique feature? It works offline, ensuring 100% privacy with no data leaving your environment.

## üåê What does Private-AI offer?

- **High-level API:** Abstracts the complexity of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Handles document ingestion, chat, and completions.
  
- **Low-level API:** For advanced users to implement custom pipelines. Includes features like embeddings generation and contextual chunks retrieval.
## üåü Why Private-AI?

Privacy is the key motivator! Private-AI addresses concerns in data-sensitive domains like healthcare and legal, ensuring your data stays under your control.

**Private-Ai Installation Guide**

### Base Requirements:
- Git clone Private-Ai repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AryanVBW/Private-Ai
  cd Private-Ai
  ```
- Install Python 3.11 (or 3.12)
- Using apt(Debian base linux like-kali,Ubantu etc. )
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3.11
  apt install python3.11-venv
  
  ```
- Using pyenv:
  ```bash
  pyenv install 3.11
  pyenv local 3.11
  ```

- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx) for dependency management.
```bash
   sudo apt install python3-poetry
  sudo apt install python3-pytest
  ```
### Dependencies Installation:
- Install make (OSX: `brew install make`, Windows: `choco install make`).
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  poetry install --with ui
  ```
### Local LLM Setup:
- Install extra dependencies for local execution:
  ```bash
  poetry install --with local
  ```
- Use the setup script to download embedding and LLM models:
  ```bash
  poetry run python scripts/setup
  ```
### Finalize:
- Installation of private Ai:
  ```bash
  make
  ```  
### Verification and run :
- Run `make run` or `poetry run python -m private_gpt`.
- Open http://localhost:8001 to see Gradio UI with a mock LLM echoing input.

## For GPU utilization and customization, follow the steps below:
  - For Private-Ai to run fully locally GPU acceleration is required (CPU execution is possible, but very slow)
### Customization:
- Customize low-level parameters in `private_gpt/components/llm/llm_component.py`.
- Configure LLM options in `settings.yaml`.

### GPU Support:
- **OSX**: Build llama.cpp with Metal support.
  ```bash
  CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_METAL=on" pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir llama-cpp-python
  ```

- **Windows NVIDIA GPU**: Install VS2022, CUDA toolkit, and run:
  ```powershell
  $env:CMAKE_ARGS='-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on'; poetry run pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir llama-cpp-python
  ```

- **Linux NVIDIA GPU and Windows-WSL**: Install CUDA toolkit and run:
  ```bash
  CMAKE_ARGS='-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on' poetry run pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir llama-cpp-python
  ```

### Troubleshooting:
- Check GPU support and dependencies for your platform.
- For C++ compiler issues, follow troubleshooting steps.

**Note**: If any issues, retry in verbose mode with `-vvv` during installations.

**Troubleshooting C++ Compiler**:
- **Windows 10/11**: Install Visual Studio 2022 and MinGW.
- **OSX**: Ensure Xcode is installed or install clang/gcc with Homebrew.
